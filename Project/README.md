![architecture](../images/streamlit4.png)

<!--Optionally, add flow steps based on the architecture diagram-->
## Flow

1. User visits the webapp, enter trip details and hit `predict`

2. Trip details are formatted and sent to the prediction endpoint.

3. Prediction endpoint uses the trained model stored in Cloud Storage to make prediction.

4. The prediction is displayed to the user.
